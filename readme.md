This repository serves as supplementary material for the appendices referenced in the paper *DeepFRI Demystified: Interpretability vs. Accuracy in AI-Driven Protein Function Prediction*.

## Repository Overview

### Appendix A.3: Full Numerical Results for Excitation Backpropagation
This section contains the complete numerical results for Excitation Backpropagation (EB) applied to protein function predictions. The data includes results for 3529 unique combinations of Gene Ontology Identifiers (GOIDs) and proteins.

**Files Included:**
- `EB_Full_Results.pdf`: A comprehensive set of tables in PDF format containing detailed results for each GOID-protein combination.

### Appendix A.4: Full Numerical Results for GradCAM
This section provides the full GradCAM results for the same set of 3529 GOID-protein combinations, offering insights into the explainability of DeepFRI's predictions.

**Files Included:**
- `GradCAM_Full_Results.pdf`: Detailed numerical results in PDF format.
